"I never believed in Santa Claus. None of us kids did. Mom and Dad refused 
to let us. They couldn't afford expensive presents and they didn't want
us to think we weren't as good as other kids who, on Christmas morning,
found all sorts of fancy toys under the tree that were supposeduly left by
Santa Claus. Dad had lost his job at the gypsum, and when Christmas came 
that year, we had no money at all. On Christmas Eve, Dad took each one of us 
kids out into the desert night one by one. "Pick out your favorite star", 
Dad said. "I like that one!" I said. Dad grinned, "that's Venus", 
he said. He explained to me that planets glowed because reflected light
was constant and stars twinkled because their light pulsed. "I like it
anyway" I said."What the hell." Dad said, "It's Christmas. You can
have a planet if you want." And he gave me Venus.
